# Working Capital Optimization using Predictive Analytics

## Project Overview

Working capital optimization involves strategically managing a company's current assets and liabilities to enhance operational efficiency and financial health. It focuses on finding the right balance between accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) to ensure sufficient liquidity while minimizing costs and risks.

In this project, the aim is to predict the timing of customer payments and supplier payments through predictive modeling. By analyzing historical data, the project helps forecast the weeks when customers are likely to pay the company and when the company should pay its suppliers. These predictions enable proactive cash flow management, ensuring that customer payments cover outgoing payments to suppliers.

## Approach

#### AR Data:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze accounts receivable data to gain insights into the distribution, trends, and patterns.
- Feature Engineering: Transform and manipulate AR data to extract relevant features for the prediction model.
- Model Building: Utilize various regression models (RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, KNeighborsRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, and SVR) to predict the week of customer payments.

#### AP Data:
- EDA: Perform exploratory analysis on accounts payable data to understand its characteristics and identify anomalies.
- Feature Engineering: Engineer additional features from the AP data that may be relevant for the analysis and prediction.
- Model Building: Develop prediction models based on the AP data to forecast the week of supplier payments.

#### Working Capital Optimization (WCO) Calculations:
- Group and sum receivables and payables data on a weekly basis.
- Calculate working capital by subtracting the sum of payables from the sum of receivables for each week.
- Analyze working capital figures to identify periods of positive or negative cash flow and assess overall liquidity.
